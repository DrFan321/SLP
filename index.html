<p>AI is the greatest development of the century, or even in all of existence. The safe use of AI allows for almost all menial and pointless tasks to be eradicated without influencing the overall product of the user. This is unfortunately only true for safe use. The siren song that AI uses to lure people into improper usage catches the attention of everybody, from students to their educators. These abuses of use can cause copyright concerns, unethical study practices, and blatant plagiarism. In the case of education, AI can be very helpful for allowing students to cheat, but it can also be useful for research, definitions, and tutoring, whilst also allowing teachers to save hours of work a week on grading. I believe in the importance of the safe use of AI in education. Due to this, I would like to help develop ideas for potential guidelines to place on the use of AI in education.</p>
