<h2>Introdcution to AI in Education and Personal Reflection on AI</h2>
<p>AI is the greatest development of the century, or even in all of existence. The safe use of AI allows for almost all menial and pointless tasks to be eradicated without influencing the overall product of the user. This is unfortunately only true for safe use. The siren song that AI uses to lure people into improper usage catches the attention of everybody, from students to their educators. These abuses of use can cause copyright concerns, unethical study practices, and blatant plagiarism. In the case of education, AI can be very helpful for allowing students to cheat, but it can also be useful for research, definitions, and tutoring, whilst also allowing teachers to save hours of work a week on grading. I believe in the importance of the safe use of AI in education. Due to this, I would like to help develop ideas for potential guidelines to place on the use of AI in education.</p>

  <h2>Our Goal</h2>

<p>As previously discussed, AI can be very beneficial to education, from saving students and teachers hours, to helping students with disabilities obtain a more personalized education catered to their disabilities. However, there is always a dark side to everything, and that is especially true for AI in education. These disadvantages range widely from blatant plagiarism, which can be devastating to students' education, to biases reflecting the groups that the students or the question fall into, such as the race or gender of the student a teacher might be using AI to grade. Prior to developing this plan I conducted a survey on the use of AI in education around the school, Western Tech (it is important to note that this survey did not survey the use of AI by teachers, which will be covered later). This survey told me valuable information. Approximately 70% of surveyed students claimed to use AI for educational purposes. When given a 1-10 scale on what extent they believed they used AI for education, they most commonly answered 2, which correlated roughly to usage for basic research (imagine Google AI). However, as expected, there were some outliers. Some students admitted to using AI to complete assignments for them, and others said that they were very reliant on AI to assist them in studying, as it was more effective for them. From this extent, the average student surveyed used AI to an extent of 3.1/10, which is a number that the surveyed population was informed to roughly correlate with assisted studying and basic research, a fair use of AI for education that helps students learn whilst also cutting time off of the original textbook method. While this average is a good sweet spot for the use of AI, the standard deviation of 2.6 (which is fairly high) reveals that there are a few outliers who overuse/abuse AI, thus leading to lack of education for those students. Our primary objective is to reduce the standard deviation of the data set by .6 to 2.0, in order to reduce the amount of people abusing AI for education heavily. This is necessary because the abuse of AI has led to some students not being able to complete the coursework they have been assigned without AI assistance, leading to them not being prepared for the everyday worklife.</p>
