  <h2>What are others doing?</h2>
<p>Overall, there have been many attempts to solve the AI abuse problem. These attempts include educating all involved in education about how to properly use AI, creating guidelines for how students and teachers alike can use AI for certain things, and trying to outright ban AI by blocking it on school devices and transferring most assignment apparatuses to paper or physical material to make using AI harder. The most successful of these methods is proper education of how to properly use AI. Students and teachers alike who know how and when to use AI are more likely to use it correctly than to abuse it because they know how to be efficient with AI without using it to do everything or nothing. This helps to prevent abuse while also introducing a new and important tool to students, who will probably need to know how to use AI in the future anyways. Guidelines also help because it points students and teachers to the right direction of how to use AI, rather than flat out telling them they are not allowed to use AI. Most failures, where projects against AI abuse have fallen short, are trying to outright ban it. Most students will see how easy AI makes everything, not know how to use it properly, and circumvent blocking methods, leading to the abuse of AI and then cheating on assignments with AI, despite a systems best effort to prevent any AI from being used. Students can help prevent the spread of AI abuse by properly learning how to use AI no matter their school systems rules and by discouraging friends and family from abusing AI to complete assignments for them or otherwise. This issue is important for everyone because the abuse of AI can prevent students from learning what they need to learn for the future as well as having teachers give improper grades to students, which leads to students not being where they need to be in the future in order to succeed in life.</p>

  <h2>What can we do?</h2>
  <p>So you are probably wondering, what can we do about AI in education? There is actually a lot that you can do to help with this. We can create posters and sit in on board meetings in order to pressure board leaders to make smart non-extreme decisions. There are also plenty of social media platforms that you can take to in order to create action in local systems to help prevent the abuse of AI. Personally, I plan to create social media posts in order to raise larger scale awareness as well as creating this website as a resource for people to learn the facts about AI in education.</p>
