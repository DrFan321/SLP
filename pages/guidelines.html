  <h2>What are others doing?</h2>
<p>Overall, there have been many attempts to solve the AI abuse problem. These attempts include educating all involved in education about how to properly use AI, creating guidelines for how students and teachers alike can use AI for certain things, and trying to outright ban AI by blocking it on school devices and transferring most assignment apparatuses to paper or physical material to make using AI harder. The most successful of these methods is proper education of how to properly use AI. Students and teachers alike who know how and when to use AI are more likely to use it correctly than to abuse it because they know how to be efficient with AI without using it to do everything or nothing. This helps to prevent abuse while also introducing a new and important tool to students, who will probably need to know how to use AI in the future anyways. Guidelines also help because it points students and teachers to the right direction of how to use AI, rather than flat out telling them they are not allowed to use AI. Most failures, where projects against AI abuse have fallen short, are trying to outright ban it. Most students will see how easy AI makes everything, not know how to use it properly, and circumvent blocking methods, leading to the abuse of AI and then cheating on assignments with AI, despite a systems best effort to prevent any AI from being used. Students can help prevent the spread of AI abuse by properly learning how to use AI no matter their school systems rules and by discouraging friends and family from abusing AI to complete assignments for them or otherwise. This issue is important for everyone because the abuse of AI can prevent students from learning what they need to learn for the future as well as having teachers give improper grades to students, which leads to students not being where they need to be in the future in order to succeed in life.</p>

  <h2>What can we do?</h2>
  <p>Unfortunately, at the current moment there are no outside government movements to fix the issue at hand. However, this does not mean that we cannot create one. There are many different types of resources that can be used in movements like these to spread awareness in the topic at hand. First, we can create multiple events at schools that have large enough populations who care. These events could be assemblies, leadership summits, or peer to peer programming to teach schools about the dangers of AI abuse, as well as the benefits of proper AI use. Second, we could take to social media to create posts on popular forums such as Instagram, Youtube, and Reddit sub subreddits related to education. These posts are more likely to be seen by youth who would consider AI abuse, and can be used to steer them off this path, as teenagers are very impressionable to what they see online. Third, we could create physical media such as posters, billboards, and even professional development lessons about how to prevent AI abuse. By doing this, we can create our own, new and effective movement that can raise large amounts of awareness to the topic. </p>
