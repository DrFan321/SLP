 <p>Apart from the previously discussed survey, I completed plenty of research on different topics within the abuse of AI for education. One of the biggest things I found while researching was teachers' use of AI, despite most people correlating AI use with students. MIT themselves wrote an article on the use of AI in grading (Silvestrone and Rubman). While they admit to the advantages of AI for grading, they also state the large amounts of drawbacks it has. Starting off, they claim that due to AI’s limited data set to receive training from, AI takes biases against minority groups, especially based on gender. This has led to students in minorities based on their names receiving lower grades on assignments even when turning in the same exact assignment as majority counterparts. This is a trend with AI in general and just so happens to have a very prominent effect grading due to its closer correlation. Another major concern talked about is the overuse of AI for grading. While AI is good at grading some types of assignments, it fails at assignments where actual viability in the real world is more important than textbook accuracy. AI just grades based on what it has learned, since it can’t use human logic, which means that nuances of the real world just go right through its thoughts. This is especially true for engineering, business, and finance, where the real world connections matter more than what you learned from the textbook. AI abuse by teachers is caused by many things, almost all of which are rooted from the policies of the school system. One of the largest ones is the lack of time during school hours for teachers to both grade and make lessons, as most school systems don’t pay teachers for grading outside of school. This leads to teachers needing to overuse AI for grading so they have more time to make lessons, which is a very unfortunate position. Also, the increase in county/state mandated tests leads to even less time for grading and so does disciplinary issues that require student vs administrator attention. Of course with all of this said, teachers aren’t the only individuals in education who use AI, students also do as well. With the increase in availability of AI within recent years, students have used AI more and more for different reasons within education. The most notable reason is the use of AI to complete written response sections and essays for them. Students also often overuse AI for research purposes, which leads to students getting and believing false information. The survey “exploring the effects of artificial intelligence..” shows some of the reasons why this might be occurring <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1498132" target="_blank">(Kilmova)</a>. This survey was conducted with the intent of figuring out the reason why students at a higher education level use AI for educational purposes. Importantly, one of the things that they heard students talk about was mental health. The use and overuse of AI helps to lighten the workload of students which reduces the stress and weight to perform well on students. This means that one of the root causes of AI use by students is teachers over application of outside class material (homework). Other potential reasons why students might abuse AI include; grade focused students, often caused by students having scholarships they can’t lose; having too many extracurriculars, they reduce time that students have to work; and laziness of the students, were AI can be an alluring option to get out of doing more work. Most of these problems can be solved with effective guidelines and proper education on AI, which you can read more about in the guidelines section of the website.</p>
