          <span class="hang"><strong>This article, written by Intel Corporation, a technology company that
          produces computer architecture, summarizes many benefits and drawbacks
          of AI in the education landscape. This article brings up several
          statistical benefits related to the use of AI, especially in the
          student landscape. This article also discusses the many shortcomings
          of AI in the classroom, especially the potential biases that AI has
          due to its limitations in training capabilities. This article is a
          secondary source due to its analysis of a survey conducted by
          themselves. This source provides information on how AI can be used to
          further education for students as well as the disadvantages to the
          use of AI, which can be used to help answer both of my questions in
          the evidence section. This source is more on the border of credibility
          due to intel's potential business opportunities that could be
          obtained by promoting AI, but due to their admission of AI's shortcomings
          and their position as an important technology and research
          corporation, it is a credible source.</strong></span><hr>

          <strong>This article, written by NEA or the National Education Association
          discusses guidelines that states such as Arizona and California have
          instated in order to regulate the use of AI for education purposes.
          The article presents the three. categories of AI, reactive, predictive
          , and generative AIs, as well as explaining them and their uses in
          education. They also explain what types of AI are useful for each
          group of individuals in education, from the students to the institutio
          n. This secondary source, due to its compilation of surveys and self
          formulated thoughts, is written by NEA, which is a group that fights
          for education rights and the educators, while also trying to keep the
          community informed about where the tax payer dollars go when it comes
          to education. This source provides valuable information about AI and
          how it often gets used for appropriate education purposes that I need
          in order to write about how to safely use AI for education. This
          source will likely be used in my background and my evidence for my

          <strong>This survey conducted by James Burriesci aims to get a direct
          perspective of what an everyday high school student uses Artificial
          Intelligence in the classroom. The survey results show a fairly
          common consensus that students must use AI for menial tasks, such as
          simple research like definitions, Google AI, and more. Most people
          surveyed did use AI for educational purposes, and those who didn't
          conceded that they used AI for purposes outside of school work. It is
          a primary source as it is simply just the results of a survey, not a
          discussion on the results or anything else. This survey is credible
          because the methodology discussed avoids any potential bias by
          anonymizing the survey and limiting the scope of the questions to
          help keep information on topic and helpful. This will likely be used
          in the background of the project.</strong><hr>

          <strong>This research paper written by Blanka Klimova and Marcel Pikhart
          discusses the results of a survey they ran on college students about
          AI and its uses for educational purposes. While also discussing many
          similar advantages and disadvantages to the other sources used for
          this project, this article uniquely discusses AI and its mental
          health effects on students in higher education. The survey shows that
          due to AI's capability to reduce overall workload, students who use
          AI for educational purposes generally are happier and less stressed.
          This secondary source, written for Frontiers in Psychology by Klimova
          and Pikhar, shows very little if any bias due to its very statistical
          analysis of collected data, going as far as to explain their methodology
          and discuss the background of the situation. Both of the authors
          have experience writing about large language models as well as
          education, making them very qualified to write and conduct surveys on
          this topic. This source helps to prove the lesser known mental health
          advantages and disadvantages of AI which helps to provide more
          evidence to answer my research questions, while providing a new topic
          to talk about rather than the strict education uses.</strong><hr>

          <strong>Instead of coming from a primarily students perspective, it talks
          about the use of AI for teaching, especially in the grading category
          of education. They discuss the advantages and disadvantages of AI
          grading, including the reduction of workload, which can be used to do
          anything else, as well as the harshness and biases of AI grading.
          Importantly, they reference how AI does not understand the nuances of
          the real world, which makes assignments related to real world
          applications of knowledge unfair to grade with AI. It is a secondary
          source as it is a compilation of some statements and thoughts
          professors have about AI for grading purposes.This article is very
          credible because it is published by MIT, a very reputable source in
          both education and technology, demonstrating their credibility. This
          source provides evidence for my research questions that comes from a
          different than normal perspective than usually shared, and thus will
          be placed and used in the evidence section of my project.</strong>
