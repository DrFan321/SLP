<p>So you are probably wondering, what can we do about AI in education? There is actually a lot that you can do to help with this. We can create posters and sit in on board meetings in order to pressure board leaders to make smart non-extreme decisions. There are also plenty of social media platforms that you can take to in order to create action in local systems to help prevent the abuse of AI. Personally, I plan to create social media posts in order to raise larger scale awareness as well as creating this website as a resource for people to learn the facts about AI in education.</p>
