<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>First off, thank you for reading this website and helping to spread the word AI abuse in education and how we can fix it. Without you, none of this could ever work. Throughout this project, I have realised that I am very passionate about helping to fix the education system and provide proper support to students who need assistance on how to properly use new technology. I have also learned that AI can be used in education in both positive and negative manors, which tells me that many local school systems such as my own, BCPS, make a large mistake by completely banning AI from education. This shows me that communities such as BCPS are very quick to judge new technology for its drawbacks over its benefits. The large amount of research I put into this project helped to contribute by allowing me to properly share what actions we can and should complete to repair the mistakes of schools around the US relating to the use of AI for educational purposes. This research has also enabled me to share the benefits and disadvantages of AI use in education with you. If I could do this project again, I would have focused more on the teacher aspect of AI abuse as it goes far more forgotten than the student aspect. Completing this project has taught me that as a citizen, I must work to promote what is right even if it seems that no one will listen to my ideas, because if I don’t, no change will ever be made.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, AI has numerous advantages and disadvantages in the realm of education. These range from saving time to cheating assignments and giving students disadvantages based on their gender. With proper education on how to use AI both teachers and students alike can reap the benefits of AI with a lessened effect of the downsides. Therefore we must take action to make changes in school systems so that they can know both the benefits and drawbacks of AI, and make a more informed decision than simply banning AI. Thanks again for reading, James Burriesci.</p>
